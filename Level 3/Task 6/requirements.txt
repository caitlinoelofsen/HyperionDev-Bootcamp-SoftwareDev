1. Discuss any ambiguities or omissions in the statement of requirements for this part of a ticket-issuing system:

- User Interface Details: There is no description of the user interface (UI) elements or how the user interactions will be handled. 

- Credit Card and Personal Identification Number Handling: There is no mention of how the credit card information is input. For example a card reader or manual input.

- Validation Process: There are no specifics on how the credit card's validity is checked or if the personal identifier is validated.

- Security Considerations: The requirements do not address any security measures for handling credit card details or identification numbers.

- Error Handling: The requirements do not address how errors will be handled. For example, if the credit card is invalid, how will the system communicate this to the user.

- Destination Selection: The description of destination selection is vague. Are there sub-categories or a search function to help users find their desired destination.

2. Write a set of non-functional requirements for the ticket-issuing system. 

Performance Requirements: 
- Response time: The system should respond to the user within 2-5 seconds.
- Transaction time: The system should not exceed 30 seconds for the entire ticket issuing process.

Reliability Requirements:
- Uptime: The system should be reliable and ensure that it can handle a large number of users without experiencing downtime or lag.
- Data Integrity: The system should ensure data integrity in case of power failures or system crashes, with no loss of transaction data.

Security Requirements:
- Data Encryption: All credit cards and person identification numbers should be encrypted during input, transmission and storage.
- Authentication: The system should validate credit card information using a secure payment gateway. 

Usability Requirements:
- User Interface: Should be intuitive with clear instructions and feedback during each step of the ticket issuance process.
- Language Support: The system should have a variety of languages with an option for users to select their preferred language.

Support Requirements:
- Technical Support: There should be 24/7 technical support provided to users.
